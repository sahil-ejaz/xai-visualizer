# 🧠 xai-visualizer (Neural Network Visualization Tool)
**Date:** 2025-07-06

**A minimalistic tool for exploring the inner workings of neural networks through interactive visual analysis.**

This application allows users to inspect activations, connections, and neuron behavior within trained models. It is designed to support explainability efforts by making abstract computation more accessible and observable.
